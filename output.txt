why are my output box of ipynb file not showing the full response of the model prediction?

Hi @sarah_khan,

This is a known issue with Jupyter Notebooks. The output box has a fixed height and width, so if the output is too large, it will be cut off.

One workaround is to use the `display` function from the IPython library to display the output in a separate window. Here's an example:
```python
from IPython.display import display
